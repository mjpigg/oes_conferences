Things that need to be added:

Performance testing:
DONE - avg time to compute generation
DONE - total execution time for a run

Speed Optimization:
DONE - only call prefs once

Fitness Score:
- advissee conflicts to fitness score
- teacher NOT more than double booked +5
- sibling proximity to fitness score
- grade level distribution (1, 2, 2) (1,2,1) (1,1,3)

Turn the whole thing into a class:

Random Seed:
- introduce random.seed() so results are reproducible

convert
Save Schedules to a Database
- store with random seed, generations, mutation rate, performance speed, date produced


Load a Schedule
- function to load a schedule into confs table to see what it looks like


Display a Schedule:
- make web interface for SQLlite confs.db
-

Evaluate a Schedule:
- identify advisee conflicts
- double bookings
- sibling closeness
- missed previous conferences
- number of first preferences met (x out of y)
- got first or second (x out of y)
- got any preference (x out of y)
- did not get one of their preferences (hilighted on display?)
